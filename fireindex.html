                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    Fire emergencies can escalate quickly, and understanding the appropriate steps can be the difference between safety and disaster. 
                    If a fire is detected, prioritize your personal safety and the safety of others. Begin by sounding the alarm and notifying emergency services.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
                    If you're in a monitored facility equipped with a fire robot, assess whether it's safe to deploy it to investigate or suppress the fire source. Avoid taking unnecessary risks. If conditions worsen or visibility decreases due to smoke, evacuate immediately using marked exits. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
                    Never attempt to retrieve belongings or re-enter the building. Designated evacuation plans should be followed, and all staff should be trained to assist individuals with special needs. Once safely outside, remain at the designated assembly point and wait for updates from emergency responders.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
                    Fire preparedness is a shared responsibility — ensure fire extinguishers, sensors, and systems are regularly inspected and that all personnel are aware of emergency protocols.
